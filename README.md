Exercise 4
Binary Trees

1.	Assume a binary tree is sorted and its nodes values are character/number.
a.	Print a function that gets a tree and a character/number and finds how many times the character/number appears in the tree
b.	Prints a function that gets a tree and a string/number and tells whether the tree contains all of the characters/digits of the string/number.

2.	Challenge:
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as “madam” or “racecar”.
A “Palindrome Tree” is a tree that is read the same from both directions (left to right vs. right to left).

For example:
G E H C B D I F A F I D B C H E G
A
B		B  
					      C   D           D   C
   E         F      F         E
G   H     I          I      H  G	

a.	Write a function that gets a tree and checks if it is a palindrome.
b.	Does this tree have to have a “mirror” left and right sides?

3.	Ultra Challenge:
a.	Write a function that saves a binary tree in a file
b.	Write a function that restores this file into a binary tree
c.	The tree that is restored from the file must maintain the same structure.
