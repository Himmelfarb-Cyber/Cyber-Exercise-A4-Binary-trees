Exercise A4
Binary Trees

Assume a binary tree is sorted and its nodes values are character/number.
Print a function that gets a tree and a character/number and finds how many times the character/number appears in the tree
Prints a function that gets a tree and a string/number and tells whether the tree contains all of the characters/digits of the string/number.


A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as “madam” or “racecar”.
A “Palindrome Tree” is a tree that is read the same from both directions (left to right vs. right to left).

For example:
G E H C B D I F A F I D B C H E G
A
B		B  
					      C   D           D   C
   E         F      F         E
G   H     I          I      H  G	

Write a function that gets a tree and checks if it is a palindrome.
Does this tree have to have a “mirror” left and right sides?

Challenge:
Write a function that saves a binary tree in a file
Write a function that restores this file into a binary tree
The tree that is restored from the file must maintain the same structure.
